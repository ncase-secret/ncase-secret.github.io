**Are these questions actually asked, or are these just questions you want to answer?**

...next question.

**So what *is* an Explorable Explanation?**

Haha, I have no idea.

But seriously: since it's early days, we're keeping the definition pretty open! By "explorable explanation" we mean something that 1) teaches something, and 2) is more interactive than a boring ol' quiz with only one right answer.

**Ooh, this is like "gamification", right?**

[sharp inhale]

hnnnnnnnnnngh okay I don't want to police other peoples' use of words, but my problem with "gamification" is that people usually use it to refer to the _worst kind_ of game design: the "do some task and get some reward" skinner box.

Those are called "extrinsic rewards", and while they're good for motivating people to do boring, routine tasks, they're _incredibly damaging_ for creativity & learning. Better instead to tap into "intrinsic rewards": peoples' inner sense of curiosity, mastery, autonomy, expression, purpose.

_That's_ what Explorable Explanations aims to do. Not wrapping stale school material in gold stars and high scores.

**Are the Featured (★) explorables the best explorables?**

Not necessarily! The ones we're featuring are just the ones we think would serve as _the best introduction_ to what play can do for learning. So if there's a thing that's otherwise amazing & educational, but only uses minimal interaction (or isn't free, or requires a download), we maaaaay not pick it as a Featured (★) explorable. Maybe.

Long story short: it's pretty freakin' arbitrary.

**How do I get started making my own explorable?**

You've already started! Browse this site for examples of explorables to inspire you. Check out the [tools](/tools) and [tutorials](/tutorials) pages, to learn how to make explorables. And if you want to get a deeper sense for *why* play matters so much to learning, check out the [further reading](/reading)!
