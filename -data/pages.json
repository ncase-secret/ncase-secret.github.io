		<p><strong>Are these questions actually asked, or are these just questions you want to answer?</strong></p>

		<p>...next question.</p>

		<p><strong>So what <em>is</em> an Explorable Explanation?</strong></p>

		<p>Haha, I have no idea.</p>

		<p>
		But seriously: since it&#39;s early days, we&#39;re keeping the definition pretty open! 
		This website contains everything from videogames, to sandbox toys, 
		to interactive graphics/articles/textbooks.
		</p>
		<p>
		In short, by &quot;explorable explanation&quot; we mean something that 1) teaches something, and 2) is more interactive than a boring ol&#39; quiz with only one right answer.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Ooh, this is like &quot;gamification&quot;, right?</strong></p>

		<p>[sharp inhale]</p>

		<p>hnnnnnnnnnngh okay I don&#39;t want to police other peoples&#39; use of words, but my problem with &quot;gamification&quot; is that people usually use it to refer to the <em>worst kind</em> of game design: the &quot;do some task and get some reward&quot; skinner box.</p>

		<p>Those are called &quot;extrinsic rewards&quot;, and while they&#39;re good for motivating people to do boring, routine tasks, they&#39;re <em>incredibly damaging</em> for creativity &amp; learning. Better instead to tap into &quot;intrinsic rewards&quot;: peoples&#39; inner sense of curiosity, mastery, autonomy, expression, purpose.</p>

		<p><em>That&#39;s</em> what Explorable Explanations aims to do. Not wrapping stale school material in gold stars and high scores.</p>

		<p><strong>Are the Featured (★) explorables the best ones?</strong></p>

		<p>Not necessarily! The ones we&#39;re featuring are just the ones we think would serve as <em>the best introduction</em> to what play can do for learning. So if there&#39;s a thing that&#39;s otherwise amazing &amp; educational, but only uses minimal interaction (or isn&#39;t free, or requires a download), we maaaaay not pick it as a Featured (★) explorable. Maybe.</p>

		<p>Long story short: it&#39;s pretty freakin&#39; arbitrary.</p>

		<p><strong>How do I get started making my own explorable?</strong></p>

		<p>You&#39;ve already started! Browse this site for examples of explorables to inspire you.
